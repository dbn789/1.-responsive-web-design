        <p>Here's a time line of Oskar Schindler's life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1908 </span>- Born on April 28, in Svitavy
            (Zwittau), Moravia, at that time a province of the Austro-Hungarian
            Monarchy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1924 </span>- After leaving school, Schindler
            sold farm equipment for his father
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1928 </span>- Marries wife of Emilie Pelzl.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1935 </span>- Schindler joined the pro-Nazi
            Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei; SdP)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1936 </span>- Began collecting
            counterintelligence for the Abwehr, the German military intelligence
            agency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1938 </span>- He was arrested by Czechoslovak
            authorities on charges of espionage and sentenced to death. After
            the annexation of the Sudetenland by Germany late that year as part
            of the Munich Agreement, Schindler was pardoned by the Reich and
            rose through the ranks of the Abwehr.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1939 </span>- His application for membership in
            the Nazi Party.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1939 </span>- He secured the lease of a formerly
            Jewish-owned enamelware factory. He renamed the facility Deutsche
            Emaillewaren-Fabrik Oskar Schindler (known as Emalia) and commenced
            production with a small staff. Three months later he had several
            hundred employees, seven of whom were Jewish
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1942 </span>- Nearly half of the workers at the
            expanded plant were Jewish. (Ostensibly “cheap labour,” Schindler
            paid their salaries to the SS.) In the fall of that year the Płaszów
            work camp opened nearby.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1943 </span>- Work camp was under the command of
            the notoriously sadistic SS officer Amon Göth, who would be executed
            after the war. Capitalizing on the officer’s appetite for drink and
            other luxury items available mainly on the black market, Schindler
            cultivated his friendship by ensuring a constant stream of them to
            the villa from which he oversaw the camp. Schindler thus managed to
            prevail upon Göth to create a separate camp for his Jewish workers,
            where they were free of the abuses suffered at Płaszów. Though
            Schindler’s motivations prior to this point are unclear, many
            scholars interpret his efforts to extricate his workers from Płaszów
            as indication that his concern for them was not purely financial.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1944 </span>- When in August 1944 his factory was
            decommissioned, Schindler successfully petitioned to have it moved
            to Brnĕnec (Brünnlitz) in the Sudetenland, close to his hometown.
            Schindler and his associates composed a list of Jewish workers that
            he deemed essential for the new factory and submitted it for
            approval to the Jewish labour office. (With several versions of the
            list known, it is difficult to determine how many people were
            ultimately selected.) Though those chosen were diverted for a time
            to other concentration camps, Schindler intervened, ensuring that
            700 men and 300 women eventually arrived at Brnĕnec. They were later
            joined by 100 more Jews who had been transported from another
            concentration camp by the Nazis and abandoned in train cars in
            Brnĕnec. Those who reached the camp spent the remaining months of
            the war manufacturing munitions that were rigged to fail. A final
            head count compiled at this time listed 1,098 Jews at the camp.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1945 </span>- On May 8, 1945, the war in Europe
            ended, and the next day Schindler and his wife fled the country with
            the help of several of the Schindlerjuden, as the Jews he saved came
            to be known. Schindler was wanted for war crimes in Czechoslovakia
            due to his earlier espionage activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1949 </span>- They settled in Argentina with
            several of the Jewish families they had saved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1974 </span>- Schindler died in Germany,
            penniless , almost unknown, in October, 9 and was interred in the
            Catholic cemetery on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.
